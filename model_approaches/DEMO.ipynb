      "1. Identify the table that contains the reviews.\n",

      "1. **Identify the Table**: First, I need to determine which table contains the reviews. Typically, in a database, reviews might be stored under a table named something like \"reviews\" or \"business_reviews\". For this example, I'll assume the table is named \"reviews\".\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Order the Results**: To ensure the results are ordered by the number of reviews, I can use the ORDER BY clause with the COUNT of the reviews. The query would become `SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE business_owner = 'Niloofar'; ORDER BY COUNT(reviews) ASC;`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Check for Errors**: I should verify that the table name and column name are correct. Also, ensure that the string 'Niloofar' is correctly referenced. If the column name is different, I'll need to adjust the query accordingly.\n",

      "7. **Testing the Query**: Before finalizing, I can test the query by running it in a SQL environment. This will help me confirm that it correctly retrieves the desired records and that the ordering works as expected.\n",
